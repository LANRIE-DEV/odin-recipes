    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made of layers of flat pasta sheets,
      rich tomato sauce, creamy b√©chamel sauce, savory ground meat (such as beef
      or sausage), and generous amounts of melted cheese, typically mozzarella,
      ricotta, and Parmesan. The layers are assembled and baked until bubbly and
      golden brown, resulting in a comforting and hearty meal that's perfect for
      feeding a crowd or enjoying as leftovers.
