      American goulash, also known as American chop suey or beef and macaroni, is a hearty and comforting one-pot dish that's popular in the United States. It typically consists of ground beef, onions, garlic, and bell peppers cooked together with elbow macaroni in a flavorful tomato-based sauce. The dish is seasoned with a blend of herbs and spices such as paprika, oregano, and bay leaves, which infuse the dish with rich, savory flavors. The macaroni absorbs the delicious sauce as it cooks, resulting in a thick and satisfying meal that's perfect for feeding a crowd or enjoying as leftovers. American goulash is often served hot and garnished with grated cheese and fresh herbs, adding extra richness and freshness to the dish.

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat. Stir in spaghettini
        and return to a boil. Cook pasta until it has cooked through, but is
        still firm to the bite, 6 to 8 minutes. Drain well and keep warm.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in
        tomatoes; cook until they soften and begin to break down. Stir in garlic
        powder, oregano, basil, salt, pepper, sugar, and ketchup. Heat sauce
        through and reserve.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat remaining 3 tablespoons oil in a separate cast iron skillet over
        medium heat. Stir in chicken; cook until browned. Stir in garlic cloves;
        cook for 1 additional minute.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove chicken from skillet and reserve. Turn heat to high. Stir bell
        peppers, onion, and mushrooms into the skillet and cook until they begin
        to soften. Stir in browned chicken. Turn heat to medium and cook until
        chicken is no longer pink in the center and vegetables are cooked
        through, about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Toss chicken and vegetables with tomato sauce and hot pasta. Serve
        sprinkled with Parmesan cheese.
