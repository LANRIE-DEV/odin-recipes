      American goulash, also known as American chop suey or beef and macaroni, is a hearty and comforting one-pot dish that's popular in the United States. It typically consists of ground beef, onions, garlic, and bell peppers cooked together with elbow macaroni in a flavorful tomato-based sauce.

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a pot over medium-high heat. Add ground beef and onion; cook
        and stir until beef is browned and crumbly and onion is translucent,
        about 5 minutes. Continue to cook and stir until liquid is evaporated, 3
        to 5 minutes. Add garlic, bay leaves, paprika, Italian seasoning, salt,
        black pepper, and cayenne.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook, stirring occasionally, until flavors come together, about 3
        minutes. Pour in broth, marinara sauce, and diced tomatoes. Pour water
        into the sauce jar, swirl, and pour into the pot. Stir in soy sauce;
        bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer until flavors
        intensify, about 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Increase the heat to medium-high and bring to a rapid simmer. Stir in
        macaroni; cook, stirring occasionally, until just barely tender, about
        12 minutes. Check for doneness after 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from the heat and discard bay leaves. Stir in Cheddar and
        parsley. Cover and let rest for 5 minutes. Taste and season as desired.
      </li>
